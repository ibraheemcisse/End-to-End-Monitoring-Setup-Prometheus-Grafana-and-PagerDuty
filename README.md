# End-to-End Monitoring Setup: Prometheus, Grafana, and PagerDuty 🚀

Welcome to the **End-to-End Monitoring Setup** repository! This guide will help you build a robust monitoring and alerting system using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **PagerDuty**. Whether you're monitoring your infrastructure, applications, or both, this setup will help you stay on top of your systems' health with visual dashboards and proactive alerting. 🎯

## 🚧 What is This Project About?

In today's fast-paced tech world, **reliable monitoring** and **instant alerting** are essential for ensuring your systems are performing optimally. This project brings together the power of:

- **Prometheus**: For collecting and storing metrics in a time-series database.
- **Grafana**: For visually representing these metrics on beautifully crafted dashboards.
- **PagerDuty**: For timely, automated alerting when things go wrong!

This setup will help you achieve seamless **end-to-end monitoring**, allowing you to quickly detect issues and resolve them before they impact your users. 💪

## 🔧 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your system. This guide assumes you're familiar with basic DevOps concepts. If you're new, don't worry—step-by-step instructions are provided! 🌱

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ibraheemcisse/End-to-End-Monitoring-Setup-Prometheus-Grafana-and-PagerDuty.git
cd End-to-End-Monitoring-Setup-Prometheus-Grafana-and-PagerDuty
```
2. Install Prometheus
Prometheus will collect and store your system metrics. Here's how to get it running:

```
# Download Prometheus
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/latest/download/prometheus-*.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf prometheus-*.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd prometheus-*.linux-amd64/
```
Configuring Prometheus: Edit prometheus.yml to scrape metrics from your desired targets.

```
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

3. Install Grafana
Grafana will help you visualize Prometheus metrics through interactive dashboards.

```
# Download and install Grafana
wget https://dl.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana-10.0.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf grafana-10.0.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd grafana-10.0.0/
```

Set up Grafana to use Prometheus as a data source:

Log in to Grafana at http://localhost:3000.

Add Prometheus as a data source with the URL: http://localhost:9090.

4. Set Up PagerDuty Alerts
To ensure you're notified of critical issues, we'll use PagerDuty to receive alerts when things go wrong.

Sign up for PagerDuty.

Integrate PagerDuty with Grafana to receive alerts.

Configure alert rules for CPU, Memory, and Disk Usage.

5. Create Dashboards
Create dashboards for the following metrics:

CPU Usage: A graph showing CPU utilization.

Memory Usage: Track how much memory is being used.

Disk Usage: Monitor your disk space availability.

```
# Sample Query for CPU Usage Panel:
100 - (avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)
```
📈 Features
